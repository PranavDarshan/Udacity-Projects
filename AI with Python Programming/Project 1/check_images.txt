Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

I have uploaded 6 images for classification:
1. uploaded_images\Husky_01.jpg
2. uploaded_images\Rottweiler_01.jpg
2. uploaded_images\Rottweiler_02.jpg - An inverted image of the dog
3. uploaded_images\Bison_01.jpg
4. uploaded_images\Laptop_01.jpg
5. uploaded_images\Espresso_01.jpg

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  Yes, all the three models were able to classify Rottweiler_01.jpg dog correctly.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No all the three models failed to classify the inverted image of the dog Rottweiler_01.jpg - Rottweiler_02.jpg correctly. 
        ALEXNET classified this as chihuahua.
        VGG classified this as miniature pinscher.
        RESNET classified this as brabancon griffon.
        These dogs are not even close to rottweiler.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 1.uploaded_images\Husky_01.jpg -- Both ALEXNET and VGG were able to classify this breed. 
                                          But the RESNET classified this breed to its closest cousin Alaskan Malamute.
                                          Although these dogs are similar, the Resnet Image Classifier could not identify the minute differences in the dog breed.
        
        2.uploaded_images\Bison_01.jpg -- All the three models were able to classify this animal.

        3.uploaded_images\Laptop_01.jpg -- All three models unabel to classify a laptop.
                                           ALEXNET: Real: laptop   Classifier:  television, television system
                                           RESNET and VGG: Real: laptop   Classifier:  monitor 

        4.uploaded_images\Espresso_01.jpg -- RESNET and VGG were able to classify an espresso.
                                             ALEXNET: Real: espresso   Classifier: chocolate sauce, chocolate syrup   

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:  VGG was the best at classifying images because it classified 4 correct matches out of 6 whereas the other two were able to classify 3 out of 6.
         But this comes at a cost of time. For small number of images VGG is the best model since it gives the most precise answer.
         But for analysing a large dataset where precision is not of much importance, ALEXNET and RESNET can be used.
